        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                When I am from is a little more complicated as my childhood was evenly split across three metroplexes: Dallas, Austin, and Houston. I have resorted to just telling people 'I am a Texas gal at heart' rather than specifying one hometown. 
                 </p>
                <p>
                Having grown up in many contexts, I aspire to think about the world analytically and openly. Many of my passions are rooted in exploring different city cultures, different experiences, and learning where I fit in best. 
                </p>
           
            <p>Over the past three years, I have been fixated on maintaining a high GPA and having strong academic involvement. While my efforts have paid off in the long run, I want to choose classes and activities that are based on initial interest rather than the advice of outside resources or peers with my last few semesters. As for longer-term goals, I am looking to relocate to Charlotte, North Carolina for a banking job. In my first year as an analyst, I want to increase my communication skills and find my place within the bank.
