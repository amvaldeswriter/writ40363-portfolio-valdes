    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>When people ask me where I am from, this answer is a little more complicated as my childhood was evenly split across three metroplexes: Dallas, Austin, and Houston. I have resorted to just telling people 'I am a Texas gal at heart' rather than specifying one hometown. When not in class, I spend a large majority of my week in the library, working on school and creating content for my on-campus job at the Sociology Department. I am additionally involved in the AddRan Ambassadors Leadership program, John V. Roach Honors Mentorship, and Phi Mu. Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy playing pickleball with friends, trying new gluten free restraunts, and spending time outdoors. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>When you first get to know me, there is something you will learn rather quickly: I don't eat gluten. For years and years, I navigated diet after diet, and treatment after treatment until finally being diagnosed with a somewhat common autoimmune disease called <b>celiac</b>. This is not something I would say is <i>important to my identity</i>, but I think it grants some insight into who I am. I have learned to value both health and wellness as well as preventative care. The following video explains this illness and why I have to live a fully gluten free life.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>

      <p>As for my academic interests, I have had several research opportunities through the Department of Sociology & Anthropology. To begin, I conducted an independent study analyzing the role of third places on TCU's campus. Third places are social spaces where people gather outside of their first place (home) and second place (work). This has been a major area of interest since high school as there is an extreme abudance of third places on a University campus (dining halls, recreation centers, dorm lobbies, study spaces, outdoor spaces, coffee shops), and the abundance of these places almost fade as life progresses in America. Secondly, in partnership with the Office of Student Success I conducted focus groups of first and second year students to understand the social reasons contributing to student retention.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <p>Like many of my peers, my initial goal for senior year was to find a job post-graduation. Now that this has been achieved, I have put some additional thought into areas of focus and growth over my last two semesters. The first goal I haev established is to take classes that interest me now that my major and minor requirements are largely complete. Over the past three years, I have been fixated on maintaining a high GPA and having strong academic involvement. While this my efforts have paid off in the long-run, I want to choose classes and activities that are based on initial interest rather than the advice of outside resources or peers. My specific goal for this course is to learn skills, such as introductory coding, that I will be able to apply to my position as an operations analyst. </p>
